Notes:

* (IMPORTANT) Slow spindle speed, faster feedrate on drilling - as there was
  some melting of the ABS.

* (IMPORTANT) Need to fix issue with clamp pockets (RectPocketFromExtent).  Make
  RectPocketFromExtent treat each connected component separately. 

* Increase maxArcLen parameters on arc to line segment conversion as feedrate
  on rounded corneres is slowing down.

* Don't pack parts too closely - there was some chatter on thin edges between parts. 

* Also, might want to use some tape in middle of ABS sheet to prevent chatter.

* Probably don't need center drill operations - save some time.
